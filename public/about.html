<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<p>My name is Madilyn Metzler, but most people call me Maddy. I am a muslim woman born on October 2nd, 2004 and I am a Web Developer 
  in training! I am taking  <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/?couponCode=24T6MT180425G3">a course by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy.com</a> 
  to become a full-stack web developer and learn the in's and out's of web development.</p>

<p>I was born and raised in Arizona where the sun shines... constantly. Because of this, I prefer the indoors. Inside is where I can let
  my mind run free and create (and not get heatsickness). I've always loved art since I was a kid. Whether it be drawing, painting, reading, writing,
  photography, etc. I loved creating. I also loved watching and observing other's creations through books, movies, shows,
  music, or video games. As I grew up, I was unsure if I could pursue a secure career in such things so I settled in retail for a few
  years. I started to grow tired of not having anything to strive for and life felt bland. Until I discovered coding. My spouse was
  taking courses for Python and showed me all the things he had learned and created. Through him I found a new passion. I researched
  all the types of jobs one could pursue in tech and coding and discovered web development. Everything about it sounded perfect for me
  and, for the first time in a long time, I had something I passionately wanted to work towards. I am excited to learn more and eventually
  be able to begin a career developing websites.</p>

<p>If you haven't already, take a look at some of the projects I worked on while training. Don't take the contents too seriously! It's
  more of a showcase of what I've learned and what I am able to do thus far.</p>
